# GraphAlgorithmsVisualizer
Project Goal:
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an interactive graphical interface for the visualization of graph algorithms. This tool will allow users to input a graph through an adjacency matrix—one of the key methods for graph representation—and will subsequently display the graph visually. The interface will enable users to apply various graph algorithms to this representation and observe the results dynamically. The goal of this program is to facilitate a deeper understanding of graph theory by demonstrating how graphs can be represented, visualized, and manipulated using different algorithms. The tool aims to serve as both an educational resource and a practical aid for students, educators, and researchers interested in exploring graph theory and its applications.

Problem Statement:
Graph theory forms a fundamental part of numerous advanced computer science applications, ranging from network routing to social network analysis. Despite its importance, the abstract nature of graph algorithms often poses a significant educational challenge. Traditional methods of teaching graph theory can be theoretical and difficult for learners to engage with or apply practically. This project seeks to bridge this gap by providing a robust visualization tool that not only demonstrates how graphs are constructed from adjacency matrices but also allows for the interactive application of algorithms. By manipulating these visual representations, users can gain insights into how different algorithms operate and affect graph structures in real time. This interactive approach aims to enhance comprehension and retention of complex concepts in graph theory, making them accessible and engaging through a hands-on learning experience. The final deliverable will include detailed documentation on the use of the interface, supported algorithms, and potential use cases in academic and research settings.
